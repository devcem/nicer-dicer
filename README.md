# nicer-dicer
A plugin that helps to slice images with grid structure. It written by Cem thanks to a bet's result between friends.

# Why?
My colleague works on Photoshop files and slices them to put into a HTML table system. And his claim is that process takes 48 (or more) minutes to complete. And i bet that i can do it under 5 minutes. So here it goes, with nicer-dicer you can slice almost all HTML table structures under 5 minutes. ;)

# How?
Just enter column and row counts and it will create a table on your image, put it to right position and click button. That's it. You'll get all images as an sliced part in a zip file. It all works on browser.
